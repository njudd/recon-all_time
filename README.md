# recon-all Processing Time
Looking at how long the freesurfer longitudinal pipeline takes.

All processing was completed on the [Bianca](http://www.uppmax.uu.se/resources/systems/the-bianca-cluster/) HPC, which is part of the [Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing](https://www.snic.se/).

I have yet to be able to figure out how to do multi-node parallizaton with freesurfer.
I found many helpful resources on parallization that work within node.
